  "summary": "The session focused on refining the AI's operational protocols by implementing a detailed confidence system that rewards engineering best practices and penalizes risky behaviors. This was coupled with a new tiered privilege structure where higher confidence grants autonomous freedom, and an automated git commit system was built to resolve a backlog of uncommitted changes without user prompts.",
