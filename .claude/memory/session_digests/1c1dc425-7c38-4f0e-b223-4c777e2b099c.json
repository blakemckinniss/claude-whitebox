  "summary": "Refactored the `.claude/agents` directory to transition agents from unused vestiges to active workflow tools by implementing auto-invocation hooks. Redundant agents were deleted, while high-value agents like `researcher` and `sherlock` were strengthened to automatically trigger based on specific conditions or context limits.",

    "Delete redundant agents (council-advisor, critic, runner) that simply wrapped existing scripts.",
    "Implement auto-invocation hooks to automatically spawn agents based on triggers (e.g., use 'researcher' for outputs >1000 chars).",
    "Strengthen and expand the responsibilities of remaining agents (sherlock, script-smith, macgyver) to ensure unique value over standard scripts."
