  "summary": "The user proposed augmenting the `.claude/settings.json` configuration by checking if raw command types could be replaced with 'prompt' types for immediate LLM evaluation, specifically targeting the `UserPromptSubmit` hook to reinforce `CLAUDE.md` rules. The assistant audited existing Python hooks, identified that 13 out of 40 were convertible (including 5 high-value candidates like `detect_batch.py`), and generated an implementation plan to shift from regex-based scripts to dynamic prompt-based meta-enforcement.",
