  "summary": "The session began with a verification of Claude Code hooks against official documentation but pivoted to analyzing and enforcing the Assistant's proactive use of research tools, which the user highly praised. Progress was halted by a low confidence score caused by a malfunction in the `evidence_tracker.py` hook, leading the user to direct a debugging effort to fix the tracker rather than overriding the system.",

    "Selected Option 3: Debug the malfunctioning `evidence_tracker.py` to legitimately restore confidence levels instead of performing a manual override."
