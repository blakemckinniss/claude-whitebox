  "summary": "The user directed the assistant to modify its internal architecture to prioritize parallel and batch processing over sequential actions through a new 'meta-cognition' check. The assistant implemented a 'Performance Protocol' involving hooks and reward signals, which was further refined to explicitly leverage Subagents (.claude/agents) as parallel context pockets.",
