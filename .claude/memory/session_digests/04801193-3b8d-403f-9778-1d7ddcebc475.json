  "summary": "In response to the user's request for improved efficiency, the Assistant designed and implemented a meta-cognition system to prioritize parallel processing over sequential actions. This involved creating performance gate hooks, updating prompt injections, and modifying the epistemology engine to reward batch operations.",
