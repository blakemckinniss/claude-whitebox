  "summary": "The user requested an audit of `.claude/settings.json` to identify potential race conditions after manually recovering a stable configuration. The assistant analyzed hook execution order and file writing patterns, specifically checking for collisions between `prerequisite_checker.py` and `command_tracker.py`. The investigation concluded that no catastrophic race conditions exist because hooks run sequentially and write access is isolated.",
