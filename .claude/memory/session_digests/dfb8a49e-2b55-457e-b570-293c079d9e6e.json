  "summary": "The user and assistant integrated \"The Epistemological Protocol\" into `CLAUDE.md` to mitigate hallucinations by enforcing a zero-confidence starting state backed by hook-based enforcement mechanics. Additionally, a reinforcement learning layer was implemented to gamify confidence tracking, rewarding proper tool usage with access permissions and penalizing shortcuts.",
