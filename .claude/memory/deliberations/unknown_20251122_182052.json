You're taking for granted that a single \"IGNORANCE tier\" (20% confidence, zero evidence) trumps explicit memories of verified functionality. Blind spot: Sunk cost in *preserving* working components vs. the optimism that \"script-first\" magically obsoletes wrappers without regression testing\u2014past sessions audited .claude but *stopped short* of deletion, calling them \"likely vestigial,\" not confirmed dead. Brutal truth: Deleting untested code in a \"Whitebox-Only\" repo risks silent failures in edge cases (e.g., council/orchestrator delegation), reverting months of \"achievements\" like subagents. JUDGE and ORACLE ignore regression risk for architectural purity; this is premature optimization chasing cleanliness over stability.
