# Scratchpad Workflow
## Instructions
1. **Plan**: Decide what logic is needed.
2. **Create**: Write the script to `scratch/tmp_<task_name>.<ext>`.
3. **Execute**: Run the script using the shell (e.g., `python3 scratch/...`).
4. **Iterate**: If it fails, read the traceback, **edit the script**, and run again.
