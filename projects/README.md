# Projects Directory

This directory contains user projects built using the claude-whitebox development tools.

## Structure
- Each project gets its own subdirectory
- `.template/` contains scaffolding for new projects
- Projects are isolated from `.claude/` implementation

## Usage
When starting a new project, copy `.template/` to `projects/<project-name>/`
